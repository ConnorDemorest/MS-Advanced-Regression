Score function: 
Teams will be scored using conventional Straight Scoring plus Seed Point Difference.
First Round=1 point per game, Second Round=2, Sweet Sixteen=4, Elite Eight=8, Final Four =16, Championship=32.
If the underdog wins then the seed difference between the two teams is added.

```{r}
# Seed1 is seed of predicted winner
# Seed2 is seed of pred loser
# Round is round of the tournament the game is played
# pred_winner is 1 if winner correctly predicted, 0 else
sample = data.frame(s1 = c(1,3,5), s2 = c(1, 1, 12), rd = c(1,1,3), pred_winner = c(0, 1, 1))

Scoring = function(seed1, seed2, round, is_winner) {
  seed_diff = ifelse(test = seed1 - seed2 > 0, yes = seed1 - seed2, no = 0)
  # If we correctly predict the winner, the score is the 1 pt for first round, 2 for second, etc
  # Plus if seed diff is positive, we add the seed diff
  score = (2^(round-1) + seed_diff) * is_winner
  return(score)
}
# For each row in the predictions data frame, get the score and take the sum to get a final score
mapply(Scoring, seed1 = sample$s1, seed2 = sample$s2, round = sample$rd, is_winner = sample$pred_winner)
```
